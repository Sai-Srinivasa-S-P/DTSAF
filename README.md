# Food Preferences and Spending Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of data collected by Ms. Bora Pajo during her time as an assistant professor at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania. The dataset consists of responses from 125 students who participated in a survey regarding their food preferences, eating habits, and spending behavior. The dataset contains 55 questions, but our analysis primarily focuses on the following key columns:

- *Student Year*: The academic year of the student (e.g., freshman, sophomore, etc.).
- *Place of Residence*: Information about where the student resides (e.g., on campus, off campus).
- *How much are students willing to pay when they eat out*: The budget range students are willing to allocate for dining out.
- *How often do they eat out*: The frequency with which students dine out.
- *Ideal Diet according to them*: Students' descriptions of their ideal diets.
- *Favorite Cuisine*: Students' preferences for specific types of cuisines.

## Analysis Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1. *Understanding Food Preferences*: Investigate students' favorite cuisines and ideal diets based on their self-reported responses.

2. *Spending Behavior*: Examine how much students are willing to spend when eating out and analyze spending patterns across different budget ranges.

3. *Dining Frequency*: Explore how often students dine out and identify trends in dining habits.

4. *On-Campus Dining*: Investigate the relationship between students' place of residence and their dining preferences, focusing on the potential for enhancing on-campus dining services.

5. *Healthier Eating Trends*: Analyze whether students express a desire for healthier eating habits, specifically in terms of incorporating more vegetables and fruits into their diets.

## Data Sources

The data used for this analysis was collected through surveys administered to students at Mercyhurst University. Ms. Bora Pajo collected this data during her tenure as an assistant professor.

## Data Analysis Tools

The analysis of this dataset was performed using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization. Jupyter Notebook was used for the coding and documentation process.

## Key Findings

- A significant portion of students is willing to allocate a budget of at least $10 to $20 for dining out, with some willing to spend more. This presents a promising revenue opportunity for dining establishments.
- Most students reside on campus, indicating potential for enhancing on-campus dining services.
- Many students dine out frequently, emphasizing the demand for convenient dining options.
- Students express a desire to incorporate more vegetables and fruits into their diets, highlighting opportunities for offering healthier menu choices.
- Understanding students' favorite cuisines can guide menu diversification and enhance dining experiences.

## Conclusion

This project sheds light on the food preferences and spending behavior of college students, specifically those at Mercyhurst University. The insights gained from this analysis can inform strategies for the food industry, campus dining services, and menu planning. By catering to the preferences and needs of this demographic, it is possible to enhance revenue generation and customer satisfaction.
